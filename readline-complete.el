;;; Commentary:

;; I find it particularly annoying that Emacs *shell* buffers do not
;; offer satisfactory completions, but xterm does. I even used
;; ansi-term for a while because of this (oh god). What I really
;; wanted was for Emacs to show completions via auto-complete.el, like
;; every other mode I use often. This package hopes to deliver on that
;; promise.

;; xterm and friends get their completions from readline, a GNU
;; library that is aware of your context and monitors your keystrokes
;; for TABs and what not so you can be shown a list of
;; completions. readline-complete.el gives you a process filter that
;; tries to parse readline completion menus and give Emacs a list of
;; strings that are valid for completion in the current context.

;;; Installation:

;; There is no one "right" way to install this package, because it
;; does not provide any user level commands. I find that it works
;; particularly well with shell-mode and auto-complete.el, so I'll
;; describe how my setup works.

;; First, let us setup shell-mode. shell-mode, by default, does not
;; create a tty (terminal) and does not echo input, both of which are
;; required for proper operation. To fix this, adjust the arguments to
;; your shell:

;; (setq explicit-shell-file-name "bash")
;; (setq explicit-bash-args '("-c" "export EMACS=; stty echo; bash"))
;; (setq comint-process-echoes t)

;; ASIDE: if you call ssh from shell directly, add "-t" to explicit-ssh-args to enable terminal.

;; Two completion frameworks are supported, you only need to pick one.

;; Auto-Complete setup:

;; Go ahead and get auto-complete.el from
;; http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/, and follow the
;; instructions for setup.

;; Then enable it in your init file.

;; (add-to-list 'ac-modes 'shell-mode)
;; (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ac-rlc-setup-sources)

;; Company setup:

;; See installation instructions at http://company-mode.github.io/.

;; Set up completion back-end:

;; (push 'company-readline company-backends)
;; (add-hook 'rlc-no-readline-hook (lambda () (company-mode -1)))

;; Finally, M-x shell, and start typing!

;; For customization, see the docstrings of `rlc-timeout`,
;; `rlc-attempts`, and `ac-rlc-prompts`.

;;; Gotchas:

;; GNU readline, unfortunately, was not made for this kind of
;; operation. That is not to say this package isn't stable (how could
;; you think such a thing!), but it is sensitive to some readline
;; customizations. Consider putting some of the following lines in
;; your bashrc (you can test if we are using Emacs for the session by
;; testing [[ $INSIDE_EMACS ]]. Note that readline-complete should
;; work with the default readline settings.  

;; - bell-style: it is preferable to disable the bell.
;;   bind 'set bell-style none'
;;
;; - completion-display-width: saves bandwidth to set this to zero:
;;   bind 'set completion-display-width 0'
;;
;; - completion-prefix-display-length: ***MUST*** be 0, otherwise
;;   readline truncates the completions. This is the default.
;;
;; - completion-query-items: Controls the "Display ... possible
;;   completions?" menu. Adjust this to keep readline-complete from
;;   downloading tons and tons of completions. The default of 100 is
;;   pretty good.
;;
;; - disable-completion: ***MUST*** be off! Default.
;;
;; - expand-tilde: ***MUST*** be off! Default.
;;
;; - horizontal-scroll-mode: Default is off, but on will save
;;   bandwidth. bind 'set horizontal-scroll-mode on'.
;;
;; - page-completions: Default is on (off on Ubuntu), but causes
;;   readline-complete to disregard completions with the --More--
;;   menu. Best to disable  this with bind 'set page-completions off'.
;;
;; - print-completions-horizontally: Default is off, but saves
;;   bandwidth to turn it on.
;;   bind 'set print-completions-horizontally on'.
;;
;; - bindings: When a command is executed, readline processes the text
;;   as input according to its bindings. Best to make tab characters not
;;   replaced by the default binding "\C-i": complete. Instead:
;;   bind '"\C-i": self-insert'
;;
;;  - windows emacs with cygwin: It's been reported to work with an
;;  alternative startup of shell mode.  Install fakecygpty:
;;  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SshWithNTEmacs, then setup and call a
;;  command:
;; (defun cyg-bash ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (let ((comint-process-echoes t))
;;     (make-comint "cyg-bash" "fakecygpty" nil
;;                  "d:/cygwin/bin/bash.exe"
;;                  "-c" "export EMACS=; stty echo;d:/cygwin/bin/bash.exe" )))

;; *** Note that this package works with READLINE. Maybe editline (BSD
;; programs), NOT haskeline (ghci, unfortunately). Shells that don't use
;; readline (like zsh?) won't work. Use bash instead. (come on, with
;; shopt you can enable most of zsh's cool features, and the user
;; experience is given by Emacs!!).

;; I don't use a Mac (Linux all the way), but I hear Apple uses
;; editline instead of readline. Consider recompiling bash, python,
;; etc with readline support instead.
